 overview of the project :

 1. Project Setup
- HTML: Create the basic structure of the user interface, including elements for adding, displaying, editing, and deleting tasks.
- CSS: Style the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- JavaScript: Implement the functionality for adding, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as saving tasks to local storage.

 2. HTML Structure
- Design the HTML layout to include:
  - An input field for entering new tasks.
  - A button to add the task to the list.
  - A list element to display the tasks.
  - Edit and delete buttons for each task to allow modifications and deletions.

 3. CSS Styling
- Style the input field, buttons, and task list to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Apply styles for hover effects and button states to improve user experience.

 4. JavaScript Functionality
- Event Listeners: Set up event listeners to handle user interactions, such as adding a task when the add button is clicked, and editing or deleting tasks when the corresponding buttons are clicked.
- CRUD Operations:
  - Create: Add a new task to the list.
  - Read: Display the existing tasks from local storage when the page loads.
  - Update: Edit the text of an existing task.
  - Delete: Remove a task from the list.

  - Loading the task list from local storage when the page is loaded.

 5. Testing and Debugging
